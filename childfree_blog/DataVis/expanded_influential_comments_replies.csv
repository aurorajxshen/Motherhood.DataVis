Here's a new idea, strip housing of its status as an investment vehicle. Remove the ability of landlords to algorithmically price-fix. Destroy the regulatory-captured zoning boards that are artificially propping up land prices. Tie wages to inflation. Standardize and regulate inflation.

Fight inflation with compulsory savings instead of hiking interest rates.

Implement public options for Healthcare, Housing, and Food, so that we actually have anchor-values in the free market for basic needs.",331

We’re watching as world leading scientists continually sound the alarm that we are irreparably harming the world and likely bringing about the end of the world - as we know it, hopefully not literally ending it but that’s possible - in the next 20-30 years.  And on top of that, now scientists are saying that their calculations were off and global warming is happening faster than they even predicted.  And the kicker is we can see it happening live before our very eyes as massive weather and climate changes devastate cities and countries across the world.  Thousand year floods are happening multiple times a year, the worst forest fires in history get worse and worse every year, hurricanes are hitting harder and earlier than ever.  Catastrophic events are becoming our new normal.

Everyone can see the climate changing and global warming ripping across the world leaving death and suffering in its path.

And yet our world leaders and corporations continue to throw up their hands and say, what can we possibly do? Not our problem.   And worse, they will actively deny the very reality that we can see and try to outlaw even saying the words global warming and climate change.  They prioritize greed, money, and yearly returns over the safety and health of the climate, world, and humanity itself.

Furthermore, they’ve tried to convince us that it’s our personal fault and our individual responsibility.  And then they have the audacity to have *shocked pikachu face* when younger generations don’t want to bring children into a world that is on track to have a devastating future.  We don’t even know how **WE** are going to manage it, how could we expect our children to.

I’m not surprised that throwing money at people and trying to incentivize people through policies that try to bribe them into having children but don’t address global warming and extreme economic disparity isn’t working.  Because people not having children is a symptom, not the problem.  It’s a symptom of our loss of hope for the future.  The problem is the very real threat of global warming and lack of economic opportunities merging to create a devastating and unlivable future. Try offering us real changes that will guarantee a hopeful future, that addresses the real problems, and maybe then we’ll want children.  But until real, meaningful changes happen that offer us a brighter hopeful future, younger generations aren’t going to be having children.",188

Standards of living are actually going down. Life expectancies are declining. And the biosphere is collapsing in front of our very eyes. 

People need hope in their lives. Traditionally that hope came from religion. In more modern times, that hope came either from religion or from a secular sense of progress and an ever-improving future. 

People have simply lost hope. We're a civilization slamming hard up against the limits of our biosphere, and our economic system, which took centuries to build up, is not designed with environmental constraints in mind.

One thing that made me lose a lot of hope for the future was something that happened in my own community. The city was debating prohibiting the installation of new natural gas connections on new construction. They weren't debating taking away anyone's existing gas service. They weren't talking about forcing anyone to change how they cook their food or heat their homes. It was a trivial, common sense way to address climate change on a local level. Let's just cap new gas installations and make all new builds electric. Yet, the political will couldn't be mustered to make even that minor of a change. The gas company lobbied and old fogies bitched about freedom and choice. At the national level, we can't even agree to cap new oil and gas extraction. 

This is a crisis that our political system is simply incapable of solving. I am now at this point firmly convinced that we are not going to see substantial movement on the climate until people in wealthy countries start dying by the millions. Until there are 10 million Americans dead in their homes from lethal heat waves, I do not expect us to make any meaningful progress on this. Until we lose a quarter of the population of Houston in a single week due to lethal heat waves and power grid failures, I do not expect serious progress on climate change.

I want to preface this by saying that I think women’s rights far outweigh the “fertility crisis.” With that said, it seems exceedingly obvious that women joining the workforce and attaining all the same rights as men is by far the leading factor to lower birth rates.

Throughout pretty much all of human history, women were treated as a commodity with barely more (often fewer) rights than a slave. They couldn’t have ambition because they weren’t allowed to do anything. If a woman even walked outside without a man, there was a strong chance of her being assaulted and raped because why would she be out and about alone unless she “wanted it?” 

The only thing women were allowed to have fulfillment in, and what society told them was their purpose, was to mother children. And children were an important commodity because you needed them to work your land and help the family to prosper. They were the opposite of a financial burden in a system that relied less on liquid cash and more on assets you created yourself.

Now children *are* a financial burden that you might get some benefit from 40 years down the line when you’re dying. Meanwhile, women have options to find purpose and fulfillment in far more things than even a man could have dreamed of a century ago. They can be a commercial pilot, a video game designer, a professional athlete, an artist, a doctor, a CEO, a lawyer, a military officer, anything. I don’t see why it’s so hard to grasp that they don’t want to just sit there and pop out children anymore… even if the government pays for every cent of child rearing, which they don’t.",33

I fall prey to it myself all the time. The future looks bleak. I have a good job and get paid more than the average american household as a single person. But I don't see a path ahead like my parents had. By my age, they already had 2 kids and owned a home. Only 1 graduated college and they didn't even make a ton of money. I can't even fathom having that situation. Fucking buying groceries every month fills me with dread because I just see the prices climbing but my pay cannot keep up.

Owning a home will probably happen eventually because my career trajectory has good earning potential, but it likely won't be until my 40s unless I find a partner who also makes a comparable amount. The idea that I will get to be where my parents were at when they were even younger than I am now, but only when I turn 40+ years old AND I am more educated and make more than they did really makes me want to give up.",4

Because that sort of hopelessness DOES arise from the failures of government, from incompetent or malignant authority figures.

Young people don't feel hopeless for no reason: we've spent our childhood watching the governments of the world essentially ignore an approaching apocalypse. I don't think older people who didn't grow up with it can quite grasp the horror and absurdity of watching the people who are ostensibly MORE responsible than you just do nothing - or WORSE than nothing - while the planet is dying. Then they turn around and tell you YOU'RE lazy.

It just totally obliterates your capacity to trust them or take anything they say seriously.

This consistent refusal to take any steps towards larger, systemic improvement on the part of the highest authorities in our society is pervasive: they don't want to make education more attainable; they don't want to take a risk on new entry level employees; they don't want to make the wages you earn at the jobs you CAN get livable.

When people in positions of authority express surprise that people of my generation aren't fertile and enthusiastic, I immediately assume they're either lying, or legitimately so stupid that they don't understand the consequences of their own actions.

Probably some time between 9/11, and the ""great recession"" happening when I was still a pretty fresh adult trying to figure things out.

I've never been in a good position to *afford* kids, but I'm also less and less convinced that it would be a good thing to bring kids into the world with the weird dystopian future that seems to be playing out. I thought we were gonna get Star Trek, not Idiocracy.

Not to even mention things like the planet being destroyed, the general political stupidity that seems to plague America, medical care and insurance being a joke, housing prices being insane, and wages not even trying to keep up with inflation while the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer and/or laid off.

If you gave every person who had kids PER CHILD enough money, pure cash the ability to pay for 100% of the child's needs including but not limited to healthcare, food, college, clothing, after-school extracurricular, childcare, housing, and entertainment, I can guarantee you everyone would be pumping out kids faster than you can say creampie. 

Instead what you end up with is a tiny percentage of the childcare costs being covered and typically only from state-approved facilities that are few and far between and more often than not substandard. Then you're expected to deal with a bait and switch of being told you'll receive the necessary investment but the minute there's the slightest financial downturn those programs are the first to be cut or they don't keep up with inflation.

What about WWII? Americans were living through bleak times, literally having their children die en masse. They had to have gardens in their houses and give up key necessities. They still had kids.

The Malthusians thought over-reproduction was definitely going to destroy society and create a mass hellscape. People still had kids.

What about the Great Depression? Americans were so desperate they moved across the country in droves. They still had kids.

I am not discounting that young people feel this way, I am sure they do. But I am doubtful this is particularly unique historically; there is always a society-level existential threat on the horizon. Maybe it's rising crime rates, nuclear fallout, maybe it's economic depression, terrorism, environmental degradation, but it's always there.

And again, I am not discounting that global warming isn't a real threat or anything, it absolutely is, but I think there's something more behind modern people having fewer kids. I suspect it's a combination of women having more freedom, better access to birth control, and the changing economic incentives (kids are an economic burden more than in the past).",6

That's a lie that was told everyone. It may be true for some spare jobs but for everyone else it's a lie. Your money is far more efficient in growth then you will ever be able to.

Second:

Back then you had the fear of war. No matter how bad it was there was still the known persistence that it would never be as bad and most people would've survived.
That's not the case for climate change. It's a thing destroys us all and with us most of the live that exists today. It's already so devastating that it's uncertain if we can contain the 2° goal, and while there is action taken it feels only done out of necessity and not because this is the biggest issue since the start of industrialization.

Relatively speaking, things did improve; suddenly wages got better, travel was possible and in reach, and short-term gratification wasn’t all that there was to look forward to. 

This experience gives me perspective now. But in terms of having children, it’s not so easy. While it is regarded as an expense, the possibility of falling pregnant naturally is proving less and less likely, and most births require some medical intervention, support, or care. Families are not a foregone conclusion for couples, whether they want that or not. Affluence is not the opposite of family. Uncertainty is certain and it’s exhausting.",1

No one 22-30 right now can do that. That's the only way they've lived their entire lives. There's never been a single moment in the lives of those born after 1993 where there has been some form of peace.

If you were born after 1993, some of your very first memories are 9/11 and the start of the latest string of wars in the Middle East. You live to see the beginning and ending of a decades long occupation in Afghanistan.

You watch whole countries burn in civil wars multiple times over. You watch the climate collapse. You watch your own economy collapse multiple times over before you're even a working adult with a career.

Your early adult years are essentially spent trying to build a career during a pandemic which damn near collapses the global economy.  Your generation just marginally avoids experiencing a mass global internal displacement from homelessness as a result of all governments pretty much have a fairly slow and ineffective response to pandemic; some governments better, some worse in this regard.

Every single year of your life has, insofar, began or ended with a new war; a new plague or a new economic crisis; or you've watched your country face the rising threat of Neofacism. All while your entire generation is, at large, far poorer than your parent generation. Your effective only hope of *maybe* having any wealth for your own retirement, is your parents leaving behind that wealth, which becomes an increasingly fleeting pipe dream as you watch the over 30s struggle to take care of their own parents and hear them talk about the overwhelming cost of care even in countries with comprehensive socialized medicine and social services.

In effect, you're 22-30, you have a career that's not going anywhere any time soon for any number of reasons; you're bracing from disaster to disaster; and in some cases, your country is actively falling apart in some civil war or an outright invasion from a different nation like in Ukraine being attacked by Russia. And this is all set to the ever encroaching reality of AI potentially obsoleting your chosen field; and seemingly, no job is safe because now they've ever started to eat into creative jobs, a field that in the mid-2010s, people thought would be safe until AGI was invented sometime off in the 2050s.

There's no hope there: why would you ever bring a child into a world where you've only ever struggled and suffered, non-stop since you, yourself, were a child? Where the only memories you have are struggle. Be it war. Or Plague. Or Poverty. Its not a mystery why no one is having kids: the world *really is* as bad as we think it is; and everyone isn't even just one major but one minor personal disaster away from being on the streets, and being on the streets is by the way, becoming increasingly *criminalized* on top of everything else.

Are we not going to consider into the equation how not having kids was almost not a viable option if you wanted to participate in society as a regular human? 

Not only was it socially not mainstream or accepted, you didnt even have the access to birthcontrol you have nowadays or the knowledge. Women didnt really have the  possibility to say no to kids and have a normal life until quite recently, not like they can today.

They’ve solved this problem already. Government capture is complete, immigration policy is directed at the behest of capital. You merely import your worker class from elsewhere, supplanting the “native” population with a new one that brings with it “conservative” views on birth control and views family planning as a question of how many children, not whether to have them. Capital sees the longer term downstream effect as a stabilization of the consumer-workforce and a reverse of this anti-natalist trend. Reversion to the mean of sustainable exploitation.


Of course in the true long term these imported workers will eventually awaken to the crushing pressure of capitalist exploitation and birth rates will drop again. But, today’s power holders won’t be alive to see that occur and so it’s not a concern. You are no longer of value.",112

My dad was a milkman. On that pay, from 1970 to 1995, we were a one income family. House, cars, camping, he had a pension, bonuses, 5 weeks vacation... 2 kids. 

...now in 2024, adjusted for inflation, with a lifetime career and masters in architecture, I finally make as much as he did in 1987.

With no full coverage health insurance for my family of 4, like he had. Yeah.

Economics is a big part of the picture, but everything is broken right now. Or at least too many things to fix with aid in one area at a time. It's hard for young people to have a sense of hope in an era when older people who had that sense of hope have had it corroded away to nothing. 

I feel you when you point out the cost of normal kids activities. It's chilling and saddening, and that's even before we consider the actual heavier cost of bigger necessities like education (where I am, private school is the only close to certain quality option) long-term. It's everything my parents struggled with times a thousand, with wages having largely remained the same since those decades ago.

So much of life seems to have been reduced to the whim of whichever obscenely rich shareholders own this or that, and everything from transparent luxuries to little pleasures is commodified out the rear. Social interaction is demanding and risky in new and different ways (or to new extents) than it used to be. The pressure to be more and do more is incredibly high. Everyone is inundated with more information, chaff and grain alike, with too little in the way of helping them sort. Healthcare, medicine, and basic things like quality, healthy food are reserved for those with more than basic means. Even having a place to live and a way to get around is so out of reach. And where I am, the cities are littered with cautionary tales of people who brought kids into this world without a way to deal with any of that. Who would knowingly bring a kid into all this?",2

Then I got a much better paying job and managed to get a house, but I am earning way above average. We are trying to have a kid now.

However, if I ever lost that job, I don't think there would be a ready replacement because it's a bit niche. Having struggled with obtaining employment after the 2008 debacle, there's always this fear in the back of my mind about shit hitting the fan. They say hope for the best and plan for the worst. Well, a lot of us have seen it pretty bad, and trying to build in a personal safety net just makes things more stressful. 

On top of that, yes, wtf is the point of all this anyway. Most everybody I know is somewhat or very stressed about their job and it dominates their mental life. It's not like you just show up and do some shit until quitting time. You get off work mentally exhausted from making decisions and dealing with all kinds of bullshit and trying to find compromises for all the competing interests.

Religion isn't enough anymore to keep the masses reproducing into a life of want and despair (especially as the natural world burns). It's why they want to ban contraception and abortion and deny climate change. It's also why they want prayer and Bible study in public schools: to force bastardized Christianity (evangelicalism) on those same unintended children, while keeping them from an education that might make them understand how fucked this system is or that there might be a better way (for more see ""project 2025"", very possibly coming to the USA early next year unless enough of us vote to stop it).",1

 Most of my friends who have had children, it has meant exiting the community to exist as an island alone, or at most, moving closer to biological family to help bear the burden.

It may be being able to take the job across the country and not living next door to your parents, all the way to going “no contact” with shitty parents. 

One of the thousands of reasons I’ve never wanted children is a narcissistic and toxic family. At an incredibly young age I decided I would never have children. I’ve never ever wanted to pass the potential for the misery my childhood depression and experience yielded. 

Millennial parents and younger that I see managing well *do* have their villages; and most of the villages centre around one if not both sets of grandparents. And they’ve all told me that they couldn’t do it without them. There are some who wish they didn’t have to involve the grandparents either, but they couldn’t have become parents otherwise.

I think the problem we're having now is that we have a rather sizeable population of elderly people, who are going to need someone to care for them and will cause an unavoidable strain on the economy. Social security systems should take care of this, but that isn't the case everywhere.

Aside from that, there's not a lot of disadvantage to having smaller populations. Food? With how much heavy machinery is used for agriculture, you essentially just have fewer people to provide for, with a minimal loss in productivity. Consumer goods? Less demand from already pretty highly optimized production lines. Even environmentally, whatever problems we may have, we have more of a runway to figure them out, since production would be slower and therefore less CO2 and other pollutants would end up in the atmosphere. Housing market? Less people needing a place to live, leading to a lower demand, leading to lower costs (outside of meddling by corps). More attention teachers can give to smaller classrooms, leading to better educational outcomes. Less traffic jams and fresher air in the cities due to fewer cars. Honestly, improvements in most metrics across the board, except for the stuff that needs sheer amounts of people.

Of course, it can go too far and the social issues would become greatly amplified, but in general it should be everyone's choice whether to have children or not, not an obligation due to social pressures or high mortality. And the ones that do make the choice to have children, should receive proper support from the government, so they can afford to do so.",5

I am really impressed that no one seems to offer any solutions besides the naive, IMHO, concept of the better times of yonder the long lost sense of hope. 
Capitalism has dug its own grave: It needs highly educated women to produce and consume. Those women emancipated, do not choose to bear children. The problem, again IMHO, is the concept of the nuclear family, the cell of the capitalist state. As we diverge more and more to individualism and the social bonds dissappear, we find ourselves lost, looking for some kind of hope.

Background:  I grew up in a relatively small USA city (~30K which was half the population it was when my parents were younger) and all my childhood heard life is pretty simple…graduate HS, marry, start a family and live happily ever after.  Occasionally going to college and starting an actual career would come up but mostly people reinforced over and over the idea your life is incomplete without a family. 

Fast forward…we decided to take a hard look at why we wanted to have children when we realized we weren’t disappointed after a couple months of trying.  In the end the primary reason was that mindset older generations hammered into us that without kids your life is incomplete if not a failure.  Looking deeper both of us questioned the world we would be bringing them into with all the issues with the environment, over population, rising cost of living, impact of AI on job market and I continue to think WW3 will happen in my lifetime.  In the end we decided having kids because our parents wanted us to wasn’t a good reason and we had enough concerns about the world they would inherit we didn’t want to add to the problem.  In fact one could argue that’s the only logical decision to come to given all the issues our world faces.  

So if you disagree with the idea your life is a failure unless you have children, aren’t sure you can afford it and/or are concerned what life your kids would have it’s a pretty easy decision to just not start a family.  It’s perfectly fine if you want to have children, but doing so because you feel obligated isn’t the right reason and I’ve found making huge life decisions like having children or getting married for the wrong reason is likely to turn sour.  Holding off having children until you can afford them is also a very responsible decision to make.  We debated adopting as that’s providing a better life for a child already born but after looking into it decided not to adopt because of the finances.  Occasionally we do regret that decision but honestly cannot remember once regretting the decision to forgo having children.  

Edit:  Grammar plus just want to add the recent attacks by the USA GOP party on adults that decide to forgo children really are disgraceful.  Like k said earlier perfectly fine if you want to have children, but deciding not to is also a perfectly fine decision.",36

If you need to move companies to keep advancing you want the flexibility to move quickly to a new state/country. That far easier to do without kids.

Considering the price of living here is 1,5 people on average, what the hell did they expect? The math ain’t mathing. On top of it people cannot save up for child care beforehand because of housing issues. The government has absolutely everything to do with it. Just because it offers a few solutions to families that doesn’t mean it’s enough. A main issue with childcare itself is they’re allowed to make profits so investors put their filthy claws on it.

Most young adults don't like the idea of dedicating the rest of their lives to providing for someone else's needs unless they have to. That's just what Western culture has evolved into.

The species isn't in danger of extinction, so I don't need procreate for that. Most young people don't believe in God anymore, so there's no spiritual responsibility to having kids. Individualism means there's no real desire to ""extend the family line"" and women who aren't mothers no longer face any social stigma.

The only reason left is ""because kids would make you happy"" but... would they? I have to spend all the time and money that used to go towards pursuing my passions and chasing my dreams instead taking care of someone else and providing for their needs. Is that going to make me happy?

I met my now husband at 26, married at 30, now 2 kids and he was the game changer. He treats me and our children incredibly well.

Why do people feel bad? Because 1) they don't feel sustainably rewarded for work, 2) and the inequality of wealth makes them feel bad about their ability to keep pace with the demands upon them.

Those things can both be solved through redistribution. When the top 1% gets 20% of all income, no wonder most people are not convinced that the value they create is not benefiting them and their family.

Shit, by some measures  if you count the room and board received by slaves as ""income"", the Average American worker receives less income (relative to the value they create by working) than a literal slave.

As in, you are exploited more today than literal plantation slaves were in the pre-civil-war-era America.

And there *are* other external factors that aren’t directly tied to security; education (both failing primary education and costs/utility of post-secondary), the very real reality of climate change, cost/reliability of health care etc. 

The long list of *needs* to not repeat the mistakes of our parents and birth a child/children that will be worse off than us keeps growing and all of them are trending downward. We are constantly being shown that things we assumed were rights are actually privileges and can be taken away, we no longer see globally uniting cooperative actions like banning PFCs and having the Ozone layer repair itself. Look at our most recent opportunities for unity, after Swine Flu, Avian Flu, Zika Virus etc didn’t end up being a big problem we had a fucking plague where people too the plagues side, what? We have climate change where people are taking greenhouse gases side, what?

As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important.

That seems...dubious. So you're driving four hours a workday? I'll assume relatively slow rate of 20 miles/hour. So you're driving an additional 80 miles per workday. At twenty workdays per month, that's 1600 miles of driving. Driving is a lot more expensive than people tend to realize. The IRS mileage rate, which tries to quantify all the costs, not just gasoline, is 67 cents/mile. So you're spending about $1070/month on extra driving costs. And if you're actually driving much faster than 20 miles/hour, these costs would soar. 

There's no way that makes financial sense. Driving is the single biggest reason middle class families wind up in poverty. People literally drive themselves into poverty. A vehicle is a consumable. Every mile you drive it burns through its lifespan. Every mile you drive has a certain probability of getting in an accident and associated increased insurance cost. Every mile you drive means more maintenance.

The biggest financial mistake middle class people make is to consider only the cost of gasoline when deciding how to travel. I really recommend people consider a proper IRS mileage rate or similar, rather than just the cost of gas. 

Another common version of this financial fallacy is that often people will think they're getting an awesome deal on house way out in the boonies. They'll try to factor in the increased costs from commuting, but they'll only consider the cost of gas, which is less than half the actual cost of operating a vehicle. They buy the new house in the sticks, expecting to make bank off their time sacrifice. A year later they're sitting there wondering why they're even worse off financially than before.",-1

We have created a world where having a child is so difficult that it is seen as no longer adding value to your life.

If you look at periods after birth control was widely available, we were still having replacement-level numbers of children.  Because when life goals are easily achievable, you start thinking about the next thing you want to do.

You graduate college with little to no debt, start a good job, get a promotion, still have enough time to engage in satisfying hobbies, buy a house, are stress-free enough to be an enjoyably life partner for someone else, get married, stay healthy with low-cost medical care, etc, and at some point you look around and think ""what other things could I add to this life?""  And a kid or two might well be part of that picture.

But when you're struggling since you were 18.  In debt the day you go to college.  Know you can never afford a house with a yard for the kids to play in.  Barely have enough time or money for your hobbies right now.

Why would you be excited about bringing a kid into that.  A couple hundred a month in child care subsidy, or free child care doesn't give you more time in the day, or less stress.

The ""economics"" of encouraging people to have kids aren't about targeted programs, it's about larger things.

People having happy, hopeful lives when they're single, will make them want to have kids to share that life with.

It's too much of a mental leap to think, well I'm unhappy when child free, so if I have a kid and get that free-child care, I bet I'll be happy then!",332

This isn't going to be a popular take, and I *understand* why it's not going to be a popular take on an individual level because I myself am childfree, but on a **societal level** any culture that accepts and encourages people to not have kids, and to choose individual fulfillment over raising the next generation will ultimately be replaced by one that doesn't.

The biggest example I can give of this is the 'shakers' (you might have heard of their furniture making skills).  Culturally, they had some attractive ideas, but their fatal flaw was that it was a religious group that eschewed sex, and thus, children.  What was once a vibrant community died out in a generation.

I say all this to point out that while modern western and asian democratic capitalism has some truly great ideas that have greatly benefited individual freedoms, they *will* ultimately fail and be replaced if costs and incentives still benefit those who choose not to have kids.  Ultimately, to be sustainable you've got to have carrots (subsidized child care, parental leave, cheap and abundant housing), as well as sticks (*deep breath*), for example the soviet union had a tax on voluntarily childless people (like myself).

I realize that would be pretty unpopular, but I am telling you, demographically, a culture which doesn't procreate *will be* replaced by one that does.  We might start thinking about the changes we need to make to modern civilization to ensure that we encourage that while preserving as many rights as we can in the process.  Else, we *will* eventually be replaced by an existing (regressive) culture with higher fertility rates.  We're talking theocracies.  I do not want to live in an Irianian style theocracy.",9

Kids are a natural next step for folks who have conquered most challenges in life and are generally happy, thriving, and optimistic about the future. You can only play so many video games and surf so many beaches until the shine wears off. One morning you will wake up and hit a wall - what is the meaning of repeatedly pursuing the same hobbies over and over again? Ever more expensive wine collection, wagyu steaks five nights in a row, starting yet another card collection when folders full of Pokemon cards collect dust on the shelf, concerts every night of the week, binge movies till you fall asleep etc., it gets so. old. And boring. Eventually even a little depressing.

My husband & I treat having children as the next big journey of our lives. We embarked on our journey with lots of couples fun but like I said it gets old. The meaning of life is not never-ending drinking or partying or yet another spontaneous beachcation. The highs are less high and they have been for a while. We want something more. Something less fleeting, something that poses a challenge again, something that forces us to face reality, and a chance to show ourselves what we’re really made of. 

Becoming a parent is the wildest thing anyone can do to themselves. As a newly minted Mom I am (of course) severely sleep deprived. And everything hurts. One little baby introduces so much chaos in my life, my house, my way of doing things. But every time I look at my baby I feel a deep well of love that surpasses anything I’ve known. I will gladly trade every good thing in my life for him. Suddenly the world is fun again. The flowers, wind, sand, sun, and rain exist clearer than ever. Because to him these things are the greatest joys in life, therefore I have also rediscovered them. 

People are more nihilistic than I remember. The loss of meaning in anything dictates they also find children meaningless, so the act of having children is a colossal practice in futility. At its core society is depressed. Governments need to treat that instead of artificially increasing fertility rates. When people are hopeful again they will have children. It’s the most natural thing in the world.",42

In some places you have a 40 hours or less work week, available child care, free school including university, half a year or more of parental leave, free healthcare and retirement free of economic issues. And people still don't have kids.

Obviously, part of it is that humanity is global now, and so even if somebody lives in a rich country, they are aware that globally it can still all go to shit. So yeah, you don't want to bring kids into a world where you don't know if there won't be a complete global collapse within 10 or 20 years for any of the anticipated reasons.

But also, it's a good point that for a lot of people, having children just makes no real sense from a personal perspective. People just want to live their lives the way they want, and for some kids are simply too much of a disruption and too much responsibility. I mean, no matter how much free school you can get, parents are still expected to care for their kids for around two decades.

Also, this actually goes hand in hand. If you are supposed to be a child until your twenties, then you can't really have kids for a few more years at least. And by the time you can, are so set in your ways that you don't want to change it.

Back in the day when people were expected to be more or less adults by the age of 15 and have kids at 18, and also there were a lot more kids all around, people were simply used to the idea that kids are just what you do. But now, it's almost a foreign concept for many.",14

The only people I hear this sentiment from are child free people. Usually people who have children will express not being able to even imagine life without them in it. It's a shame you have to make the permanent decision with so much uncertainty, but ever since life evolved on this planet, living a happy one has never been a guarantee and animals *still* had children at every possible opportunity. Honestly I find the notion kinda funny. We had an asteroid destroy most of the life on this planet and plunge us into a deep ice age, and our ancestors found the spirit to fornicate.

However, as far as the environment:  

>A carcinogenic, toxic and polluted environment

While there are some very valid concerns here that we should be working harder on (climate change, microplastics, farming with chemicals), I think it's also important to remember that we have still made huge progress!  

Microplastics suck, but... 30 or 40 years ago, as another redditor put it, ""the whole world smelled like cigarette smoke.""  Every bar/restaurant, many shopping malls, hotels, some houses and apartments, you name it!  

Not to mention leaded gasoline, until 1980 or so.  Everybody spent a good chunk of their lives breathing in lead, and also lead paint.  Even aside from lead, car's fuel economy and emissions are *vastly* better than in 1980 (even for today's gas cars, not to mention EVs).  

Microplastics and farming chemicals aren't great, but, it's pretty clear they're not nearly as damaging to health as widespread smoking and leaded gasoline.  Not even close.  

And climate change?  Much more work is needed.  But, the US got 15% of its energy from wind and solar this year!  (Another 23% from hydro and nuclear).  When I was a kid in the early 90's, *even 1%* from wind/solar seemed like a dream! 

To someone old enough to remember the 1970's or the 80's (me, barely), it looks like we're making great progress!  

It's probably fair to say our environment is the cleanest it's been in half a century, at least.  Also, going back further, prior to cars, city streets in 1900 were covered in literal horse crap, and smelled like it.",1

Humans just are not good at mitigating risks when the harms aren’t immediate and obvious and the cost of mitigation now seems difficult while the benefits of avoiding the risk are intangible in the sense that even if you curb your lifestyles to prevent climate change, you won’t see a positive effect in your life, just you won’t see a negative. But humans are not good at understanding that in a deep level. Like with Y2K and all the work that went into preventing issues, now lots of people think the work wasn’t necessary because nothing happened. Or efforts to prevent previous pandemics that were successful- well there wasn’t a pandemic so did we really need to do anything? Even with Covid so many people think lockdowns etc weren’t necessary just because they didn’t end up seeing bodies piling in the streets everywhere. When if there hadn’t been lockdowns who knows how many more would’ve died?

Of course there are a lot of humans who understand this and don’t fall foul of this huge logical error but most seem to. You’d need those humans who understand to basically take over and fix the issue single mindedly, paying no attention to getting votes or appeasing lobbyists. But those types of humans are usually the type that don’t want to thwart democracy or don’t have the resources or power to get anywhere close to establishing a dictatorship.

Sometimes I do think democracy is not good at handling large long term crises. It is not always the best most effective form of government in every era I think. But then the likelihood of getting decent humans in charge in a dictatorship is practically zero. So we’re screwed.

It hurts so much that humanity is so split between stupid and hateful people and intelligent and decent people, and the stupid hateful ones seem to consistently destroy everything for everyone else.",33

lggofov,"The facts of the so-called fertility crisis are well publicized: Birth rates in the United States have been trending down for nearly two decades, and other wealthy countries are experiencing the same. Among those proposing solutions to reverse the trend, the conventional wisdom goes that if only the government were to offer more financial support to parents, birth rates would start ticking up again.

But what if that wisdom is wrong?

In 1960, American women had, on average, 3.6 children; in 2023, the total fertility rate (the average number of children a woman expects to have in her lifetime) was 1.62, the lowest on record and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Meanwhile, rates of childlessness are rising: In 2018, more than one in seven women aged 40 to 44 had no biological children, compared with one in 10 in 1976. And according to a new report from Pew Research Center, the share of 

American adults younger than 50 who say they are unlikely to ever have children rose 10 percentage points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. In mainstream American discourse, explanations for these trends tend to focus on economic constraints: People are deciding not to have kids because of the high cost of child care, a lack of parental leave, and the wage penalty mothers face. Some policy makers (and concerned citizens) suggest that expensive government interventions could help change people’s minds.

But data from other parts of the world, including countries with generous family policies, suggest otherwise. Today, every OECD country except Israel has a below-replacement fertility rate, and the speed of the decline during the past decade has outpaced demographers’ expectations. In 2022, the average fertility rate of European Union countries was 1.46; in 2023, South Korea’s was 0.72, the lowest in the world.

South Korea has spent more than $200 billion over the past 16 years on policies meant to boost fertility, including monthly stipends for parents, expanded parental leave, and subsidized prenatal care—yet its total fertility rate fell by 25 percent in that time. France spends a higher percentage of its GDP on family than any other OECD member country, but last year saw its lowest number of births since World War II. Even the Nordic countries, with their long-established welfare states, child-care guarantees, and policies of extended parental leave, are experiencing sharp fertility declines.

Policy shifts that make life easier and less expensive for parents are worthwhile in their own right. But so far, such improvements haven’t changed most countries’ low-fertility rates. This suggests the existence of another, under-discussed reason people aren’t having kids—one that, I have come to believe, has little to do with policy and everything to do with a deep but unquantifiable human need.

That need is for meaning. In trying to solve the fertility puzzle, thinkers have cited people’s concerns over finances, climate change, political instability, or even potential war. But in listening closely to people’s stories, I’ve detected a broader thread of uncertainty—about the value of life and a reason for being. Many in the current generation of young adults don’t seem totally convinced of their own purpose or the purpose of humanity at large, let alone that of a child. It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.

In his 1960s work on the economics of the family, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Gary Becker theorized that household decisions, including fertility choices, could be analyzed through an economic lens. More specifically, children could be analogized to goods, like a house or a car; the number that parents had was related to what they could afford in terms of time and money. By this logic, making the goods less expensive—expanding household budgets via subsidies, return-to-career guarantees, and other financial carrots—should be enough to push parents to have more kids.

Governments have generally hewed to this assumption when launching pronatal policies. But two new books exploring why people do or don’t have children—works that take wildly different approaches to the question—suggest that this method is flawed.

In Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, an economist and a Catholic mother of eight, compiles interviews with 55 women from across the United States who have five or more children—hers is a qualitative study of Americans happily breaking from the low-birth-rate norm. Connecting the author and her unusual subjects (only about 5 percent of U.S. mothers have five or more kids) is a shared certainty that children are an unqualified good, and that raising them is an activity freighted with positive meaning.

Then there are those who are much less sure. In What Are Children For? On Ambivalence and Choice, Anastasia Berg, an academic and editor at The Point, and Rachel Wiseman, an editor at the same magazine, engage literature, philosophy, and anti-natalist texts to wrestle with whether children are worth having at all. The decision is described as “paralyzing” and “anxiety-provoking,” to be approached with trepidation (even though the authors find individual clarity by the end). But their book echoes Pakaluk’s in one striking respect: Both works share the view that current political strategies for encouraging people to have children are lacking a crucial element. “As attractive as economics may be as a solution to the riddle of the growing ambivalence about having children, it is partial at best,” Berg and Wiseman write. Pakaluk observes, “Cash incentives and tax relief won’t persuade people to give up their lives. People will do that for God, for their families, and for their future children.” In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

In many quarters, that sort of certainty has become elusive. Indeed, Berg and Wiseman dwell on its opposite: anxiety about whether having children is good or whether it’s an imposition, a decision that might deprive a person of individual fulfillment or even make the world worse in the long run—by, for instance, contributing to climate change, overpopulation, or the continuation of regressive gender norms. “Becoming a parent,” they write, “can seem less like a transition and more like throwing yourself off a cliff.”

The authors touch on the standard narratives of why young people are delaying or forgoing children—financial anxiety, difficulty finding a partner, worries that having kids will be incompatible with their career—but these they describe as “externals,” borrowing a term from the family therapist and author Ann Davidman, not the core concern. One of their interviewees notes that if money were no object, she would be “at least neutral” on the subject of having a child, which is still some distance from positive. Instead, more existential worries emerge, pointing to a loss of stabilizing self-confidence among recent generations, or to the lack of an overarching framework (religious or otherwise) that might help guide people toward a “good” life. “The old frameworks, whatever they were, no longer seem to apply,” Berg and Wiseman write. “And the new ones provide us with hardly any answers at all.”

The mothers whom Pakaluk profiles approach childbearing with far less ambiguity. As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important. Or a greater good.”

It’s a deceptively simple claim—and reinforces the notion that if people are going to have children, they need more than a hunch that human life is valuable. “It is not just the possibility of goodness but its actuality that fuels our deepest longing to ensure a human future,” Berg and Wiseman propose. And yet, we live in a time when even those who are certain about having kids are sometimes treated with skepticism. To proclaim that parenthood could be a positive experience is, in some circles, slightly gauche. “To assert the goodness of one’s own life,” the authors write, “is to risk coming across as privileged, or just hopelessly naive.”

Contrast that with the attitude of Hannah, a mother of seven who tells Pakaluk that each new child “brings benefit to the family and to the world.” She and the other mothers exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.",0.005696757230499562,55,"Very interesting. I do agree that pro-natal sentiment isn't as popular as it perhaps used to be. This sense of needing meaning or purpose when having children is perhaps a key missing component.

I just hope that people don't discount the economic/social support side. I definitely think it's still half of the equation. People may not feel there's any meaning to having a child if it means giving up much of their life in order for their child to be as well off, or even worse off, than they are. 

There's not a lot of romance or joy to bring to poverty. And some may innately question why they should ensure humanity's future if their children aren't likely to have a good place in it.",24

Policy shifts that make life easier and less expensive for parents are worthwhile in their own right. But so far, such improvements haven’t changed most countries’ low-fertility rates. This suggests the existence of another, under-discussed reason people aren’t having kids—one that, I have come to believe, has little to do with policy and everything to do with a deep but unquantifiable human need.

That need is for meaning. In trying to solve the fertility puzzle, thinkers have cited people’s concerns over finances, climate change, political instability, or even potential war. But in listening closely to people’s stories, I’ve detected a broader thread of uncertainty—about the value of life and a reason for being. Many in the current generation of young adults don’t seem totally convinced of their own purpose or the purpose of humanity at large, let alone that of a child. It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.

In his 1960s work on the economics of the family, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Gary Becker theorized that household decisions, including fertility choices, could be analyzed through an economic lens. More specifically, children could be analogized to goods, like a house or a car; the number that parents had was related to what they could afford in terms of time and money. By this logic, making the goods less expensive—expanding household budgets via subsidies, return-to-career guarantees, and other financial carrots—should be enough to push parents to have more kids.

Governments have generally hewed to this assumption when launching pronatal policies. But two new books exploring why people do or don’t have children—works that take wildly different approaches to the question—suggest that this method is flawed.

In Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, an economist and a Catholic mother of eight, compiles interviews with 55 women from across the United States who have five or more children—hers is a qualitative study of Americans happily breaking from the low-birth-rate norm. Connecting the author and her unusual subjects (only about 5 percent of U.S. mothers have five or more kids) is a shared certainty that children are an unqualified good, and that raising them is an activity freighted with positive meaning.

Then there are those who are much less sure. In What Are Children For? On Ambivalence and Choice, Anastasia Berg, an academic and editor at The Point, and Rachel Wiseman, an editor at the same magazine, engage literature, philosophy, and anti-natalist texts to wrestle with whether children are worth having at all. The decision is described as “paralyzing” and “anxiety-provoking,” to be approached with trepidation (even though the authors find individual clarity by the end). But their book echoes Pakaluk’s in one striking respect: Both works share the view that current political strategies for encouraging people to have children are lacking a crucial element. “As attractive as economics may be as a solution to the riddle of the growing ambivalence about having children, it is partial at best,” Berg and Wiseman write. Pakaluk observes, “Cash incentives and tax relief won’t persuade people to give up their lives. People will do that for God, for their families, and for their future children.” In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

In many quarters, that sort of certainty has become elusive. Indeed, Berg and Wiseman dwell on its opposite: anxiety about whether having children is good or whether it’s an imposition, a decision that might deprive a person of individual fulfillment or even make the world worse in the long run—by, for instance, contributing to climate change, overpopulation, or the continuation of regressive gender norms. “Becoming a parent,” they write, “can seem less like a transition and more like throwing yourself off a cliff.”

The authors touch on the standard narratives of why young people are delaying or forgoing children—financial anxiety, difficulty finding a partner, worries that having kids will be incompatible with their career—but these they describe as “externals,” borrowing a term from the family therapist and author Ann Davidman, not the core concern. One of their interviewees notes that if money were no object, she would be “at least neutral” on the subject of having a child, which is still some distance from positive. Instead, more existential worries emerge, pointing to a loss of stabilizing self-confidence among recent generations, or to the lack of an overarching framework (religious or otherwise) that might help guide people toward a “good” life. “The old frameworks, whatever they were, no longer seem to apply,” Berg and Wiseman write. “And the new ones provide us with hardly any answers at all.”

The mothers whom Pakaluk profiles approach childbearing with far less ambiguity. As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important. Or a greater good.”

It’s a deceptively simple claim—and reinforces the notion that if people are going to have children, they need more than a hunch that human life is valuable. “It is not just the possibility of goodness but its actuality that fuels our deepest longing to ensure a human future,” Berg and Wiseman propose. And yet, we live in a time when even those who are certain about having kids are sometimes treated with skepticism. To proclaim that parenthood could be a positive experience is, in some circles, slightly gauche. “To assert the goodness of one’s own life,” the authors write, “is to risk coming across as privileged, or just hopelessly naive.”

Contrast that with the attitude of Hannah, a mother of seven who tells Pakaluk that each new child “brings benefit to the family and to the world.” She and the other mothers exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.",0.005696757230499562,55,"I always thought it was pretty obvious that the decision to have children wasn't strongly tied to economic status.

lggofov,"The facts of the so-called fertility crisis are well publicized: Birth rates in the United States have been trending down for nearly two decades, and other wealthy countries are experiencing the same. Among those proposing solutions to reverse the trend, the conventional wisdom goes that if only the government were to offer more financial support to parents, birth rates would start ticking up again.

But what if that wisdom is wrong?

In 1960, American women had, on average, 3.6 children; in 2023, the total fertility rate (the average number of children a woman expects to have in her lifetime) was 1.62, the lowest on record and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Meanwhile, rates of childlessness are rising: In 2018, more than one in seven women aged 40 to 44 had no biological children, compared with one in 10 in 1976. And according to a new report from Pew Research Center, the share of 

American adults younger than 50 who say they are unlikely to ever have children rose 10 percentage points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. In mainstream American discourse, explanations for these trends tend to focus on economic constraints: People are deciding not to have kids because of the high cost of child care, a lack of parental leave, and the wage penalty mothers face. Some policy makers (and concerned citizens) suggest that expensive government interventions could help change people’s minds.

But data from other parts of the world, including countries with generous family policies, suggest otherwise. Today, every OECD country except Israel has a below-replacement fertility rate, and the speed of the decline during the past decade has outpaced demographers’ expectations. In 2022, the average fertility rate of European Union countries was 1.46; in 2023, South Korea’s was 0.72, the lowest in the world.

South Korea has spent more than $200 billion over the past 16 years on policies meant to boost fertility, including monthly stipends for parents, expanded parental leave, and subsidized prenatal care—yet its total fertility rate fell by 25 percent in that time. France spends a higher percentage of its GDP on family than any other OECD member country, but last year saw its lowest number of births since World War II.

In 1960, American women had, on average, 3.6 children; in 2023, the total fertility rate (the average number of children a woman expects to have in her lifetime) was 1.62, the lowest on record and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Meanwhile, rates of childlessness are rising: In 2018, more than one in seven women aged 40 to 44 had no biological children, compared with one in 10 in 1976. And according to a new report from Pew Research Center, the share of 

American adults younger than 50 who say they are unlikely to ever have children rose 10 percentage points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. In mainstream American discourse, explanations for these trends tend to focus on economic constraints: People are deciding not to have kids because of the high cost of child care, a lack of parental leave, and the wage penalty mothers face. Some policy makers (and concerned citizens) suggest that expensive government interventions could help change people’s minds.

But data from other parts of the world, including countries with generous family policies, suggest otherwise. Today, every OECD country except Israel has a below-replacement fertility rate, and the speed of the decline during the past decade has outpaced demographers’ expectations. In 2022, the average fertility rate of European Union countries was 1.46; in 2023, South Korea’s was 0.72, the lowest in the world.

South Korea has spent more than $200 billion over the past 16 years on policies meant to boost fertility, including monthly stipends for parents, expanded parental leave, and subsidized prenatal care—yet its total fertility rate fell by 25 percent in that time. France spends a higher percentage of its GDP on family than any other OECD member country, but last year saw its lowest number of births since World War II. Even the Nordic countries, with their long-established welfare states, child-care guarantees, and policies of extended parental leave, are experiencing sharp fertility declines.

Policy shifts that make life easier and less expensive for parents are worthwhile in their own right. But so far, such improvements haven’t changed most countries’ low-fertility rates. This suggests the existence of another, under-discussed reason people aren’t having kids—one that, I have come to believe, has little to do with policy and everything to do with a deep but unquantifiable human need.

That need is for meaning. In trying to solve the fertility puzzle, thinkers have cited people’s concerns over finances, climate change, political instability, or even potential war. But in listening closely to people’s stories, I’ve detected a broader thread of uncertainty—about the value of life and a reason for being. Many in the current generation of young adults don’t seem totally convinced of their own purpose or the purpose of humanity at large, let alone that of a child. It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.

In his 1960s work on the economics of the family, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Gary Becker theorized that household decisions, including fertility choices, could be analyzed through an economic lens. More specifically, children could be analogized to goods, like a house or a car; the number that parents had was related to what they could afford in terms of time and money. By this logic, making the goods less expensive—expanding household budgets via subsidies, return-to-career guarantees, and other financial carrots—should be enough to push parents to have more kids.

Governments have generally hewed to this assumption when launching pronatal policies. But two new books exploring why people do or don’t have children—works that take wildly different approaches to the question—suggest that this method is flawed.

In Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, an economist and a Catholic mother of eight, compiles interviews with 55 women from across the United States who have five or more children—hers is a qualitative study of Americans happily breaking from the low-birth-rate norm. Connecting the author and her unusual subjects (only about 5 percent of U.S. mothers have five or more kids) is a shared certainty that children are an unqualified good, and that raising them is an activity freighted with positive meaning.

Then there are those who are much less sure. In What Are Children For? On Ambivalence and Choice, Anastasia Berg, an academic and editor at The Point, and Rachel Wiseman, an editor at the same magazine, engage literature, philosophy, and anti-natalist texts to wrestle with whether children are worth having at all. The decision is described as “paralyzing” and “anxiety-provoking,” to be approached with trepidation (even though the authors find individual clarity by the end).

Pakaluk observes, “Cash incentives and tax relief won’t persuade people to give up their lives. People will do that for God, for their families, and for their future children.” In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

In many quarters, that sort of certainty has become elusive. Indeed, Berg and Wiseman dwell on its opposite: anxiety about whether having children is good or whether it’s an imposition, a decision that might deprive a person of individual fulfillment or even make the world worse in the long run—by, for instance, contributing to climate change, overpopulation, or the continuation of regressive gender norms. “Becoming a parent,” they write, “can seem less like a transition and more like throwing yourself off a cliff.”

The authors touch on the standard narratives of why young people are delaying or forgoing children—financial anxiety, difficulty finding a partner, worries that having kids will be incompatible with their career—but these they describe as “externals,” borrowing a term from the family therapist and author Ann Davidman, not the core concern. One of their interviewees notes that if money were no object, she would be “at least neutral” on the subject of having a child, which is still some distance from positive.

The mothers whom Pakaluk profiles approach childbearing with far less ambiguity. As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important. Or a greater good.”

It’s a deceptively simple claim—and reinforces the notion that if people are going to have children, they need more than a hunch that human life is valuable. “It is not just the possibility of goodness but its actuality that fuels our deepest longing to ensure a human future,” Berg and Wiseman propose. And yet, we live in a time when even those who are certain about having kids are sometimes treated with skepticism. To proclaim that parenthood could be a positive experience is, in some circles, slightly gauche. “To assert the goodness of one’s own life,” the authors write, “is to risk coming across as privileged, or just hopelessly naive.”

Contrast that with the attitude of Hannah, a mother of seven who tells Pakaluk that each new child “brings benefit to the family and to the world.” She and the other mothers exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.",0.005696757230499562,55,"Message aside, it's been a while since I read such a nicely worded article.

The mothers whom Pakaluk profiles approach childbearing with far less ambiguity. As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important. Or a greater good.”

It’s a deceptively simple claim—and reinforces the notion that if people are going to have children, they need more than a hunch that human life is valuable. “It is not just the possibility of goodness but its actuality that fuels our deepest longing to ensure a human future,” Berg and Wiseman propose. And yet, we live in a time when even those who are certain about having kids are sometimes treated with skepticism. To proclaim that parenthood could be a positive experience is, in some circles, slightly gauche. “To assert the goodness of one’s own life,” the authors write, “is to risk coming across as privileged, or just hopelessly naive.”

Contrast that with the attitude of Hannah, a mother of seven who tells Pakaluk that each new child “brings benefit to the family and to the world.” She and the other mothers exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.",0.005696757230499562,55,">In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

This is very well said. Although it would certianly make more sense if we would see the economy changing for the better, but it just keeps getting worse and worse.

I remember the beautiful and big houses where the families from my favorite TV series and cartoons of the 80's, 90's and early 00's lived. The mother was usually a housewife, and the father worked some ordinary job with a high school diploma, but he still managed to provide financially for the whole family. This would be impossible today, not to mention the amount of education and experience you have to go through to get an ordinary job. Both father and mother have to work full time in order to be able to cover the rent and utilities, so this is not about buying some kind of real estate, no. That is only reserved for the people who inherited their wealth, and not the ones who want to earn it. Wage slavery is real and it's only getting worse, favoring the ones who don't have to work at all.

What's the point of having kids when you know they will have to suffer even more than we do now? There's a reason why slaves didn't want to have children when they were owned by cruel slave owners. They were literally forced to have children so the slave owners could further exploit their children for labor, earning themselves a bigger profit.",3
lggofov,"The facts of the so-called fertility crisis are well publicized: Birth rates in the United States have been trending down for nearly two decades, and other wealthy countries are experiencing the same. Among those proposing solutions to reverse the trend, the conventional wisdom goes that if only the government were to offer more financial support to parents, birth rates would start ticking up again.

But what if that wisdom is wrong?

In 1960, American women had, on average, 3.6 children; in 2023, the total fertility rate (the average number of children a woman expects to have in her lifetime) was 1.62, the lowest on record and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Meanwhile, rates of childlessness are rising: In 2018, more than one in seven women aged 40 to 44 had no biological children, compared with one in 10 in 1976. And according to a new report from Pew Research Center, the share of 

American adults younger than 50 who say they are unlikely to ever have children rose 10 percentage points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. In mainstream American discourse, explanations for these trends tend to focus on economic constraints: People are deciding not to have kids because of the high cost of child care, a lack of parental leave, and the wage penalty mothers face. Some policy makers (and concerned citizens) suggest that expensive government interventions could help change people’s minds.

But data from other parts of the world, including countries with generous family policies, suggest otherwise. Today, every OECD country except Israel has a below-replacement fertility rate, and the speed of the decline during the past decade has outpaced demographers’ expectations. In 2022, the average fertility rate of European Union countries was 1.46; in 2023, South Korea’s was 0.72, the lowest in the world.

South Korea has spent more than $200 billion over the past 16 years on policies meant to boost fertility, including monthly stipends for parents, expanded parental leave, and subsidized prenatal care—yet its total fertility rate fell by 25 percent in that time. France spends a higher percentage of its GDP on family than any other OECD member country, but last year saw its lowest number of births since World War II. Even the Nordic countries, with their long-established welfare states, child-care guarantees, and policies of extended parental leave, are experiencing sharp fertility declines.

Policy shifts that make life easier and less expensive for parents are worthwhile in their own right. But so far, such improvements haven’t changed most countries’ low-fertility rates. This suggests the existence of another, under-discussed reason people aren’t having kids—one that, I have come to believe, has little to do with policy and everything to do with a deep but unquantifiable human need.

That need is for meaning. In trying to solve the fertility puzzle, thinkers have cited people’s concerns over finances, climate change, political instability, or even potential war. But in listening closely to people’s stories, I’ve detected a broader thread of uncertainty—about the value of life and a reason for being. Many in the current generation of young adults don’t seem totally convinced of their own purpose or the purpose of humanity at large, let alone that of a child. It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.

In his 1960s work on the economics of the family, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Gary Becker theorized that household decisions, including fertility choices, could be analyzed through an economic lens. More specifically, children could be analogized to goods, like a house or a car; the number that parents had was related to what they could afford in terms of time and money. By this logic, making the goods less expensive—expanding household budgets via subsidies, return-to-career guarantees, and other financial carrots—should be enough to push parents to have more kids.

Governments have generally hewed to this assumption when launching pronatal policies. But two new books exploring why people do or don’t have children—works that take wildly different approaches to the question—suggest that this method is flawed.

In Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, an economist and a Catholic mother of eight, compiles interviews with 55 women from across the United States who have five or more children—hers is a qualitative study of Americans happily breaking from the low-birth-rate norm. Connecting the author and her unusual subjects (only about 5 percent of U.S. mothers have five or more kids) is a shared certainty that children are an unqualified good, and that raising them is an activity freighted with positive meaning.

Then there are those who are much less sure. In What Are Children For? On Ambivalence and Choice, Anastasia Berg, an academic and editor at The Point, and Rachel Wiseman, an editor at the same magazine, engage literature, philosophy, and anti-natalist texts to wrestle with whether children are worth having at all. The decision is described as “paralyzing” and “anxiety-provoking,” to be approached with trepidation (even though the authors find individual clarity by the end). But their book echoes Pakaluk’s in one striking respect: Both works share the view that current political strategies for encouraging people to have children are lacking a crucial element. “As attractive as economics may be as a solution to the riddle of the growing ambivalence about having children, it is partial at best,” Berg and Wiseman write. Pakaluk observes, “Cash incentives and tax relief won’t persuade people to give up their lives. People will do that for God, for their families, and for their future children.” In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

In many quarters, that sort of certainty has become elusive. Indeed, Berg and Wiseman dwell on its opposite: anxiety about whether having children is good or whether it’s an imposition, a decision that might deprive a person of individual fulfillment or even make the world worse in the long run—by, for instance, contributing to climate change, overpopulation, or the continuation of regressive gender norms. “Becoming a parent,” they write, “can seem less like a transition and more like throwing yourself off a cliff.”

The authors touch on the standard narratives of why young people are delaying or forgoing children—financial anxiety, difficulty finding a partner, worries that having kids will be incompatible with their career—but these they describe as “externals,” borrowing a term from the family therapist and author Ann Davidman, not the core concern. One of their interviewees notes that if money were no object, she would be “at least neutral” on the subject of having a child, which is still some distance from positive. Instead, more existential worries emerge, pointing to a loss of stabilizing self-confidence among recent generations, or to the lack of an overarching framework (religious or otherwise) that might help guide people toward a “good” life. “The old frameworks, whatever they were, no longer seem to apply,” Berg and Wiseman write. “And the new ones provide us with hardly any answers at all.”

The only thing that makes this a ""crisis"" is that it means a lot of the current systems in economics and culture (particularly ethnocentrism - which is the true driving force behind a lot of the government interventions on this) will have to be dismantled because they only work when birthrate is rising steadily. 

What makes us human is our ability at introspection of ourselves individually and our species as a whole. We are presumably the only species that CAN be aware that most of the world's children do not get to live like my child would, and that the traditional perspective that every woman/man must want children to feel fulfilled or be accepted, has caused a lot of child abuse and neglect even where poverty was not an issue. The people who have kids should REALLY want kids. 

I also remember in school/college learning all about how our world population could crescendo into an unsustainable limit. Famine, war, pandemics, and eventually going off planet would likely result in some dystopian situation where we tap space or resources. Disasters and pandemics seemed like some natural way of Earth battling back, and even if that is just allegory, there is truth to it. Where there is population density, there is exceptional loss of life. And for the record, I don't think there is any reason to believe fertility itself is in jeopardy or that our desire for kids will actually halt or reach critical lows. I think it is balancing out without natural intervention. I think the people who are not having kids or only having a couple of kids would have ALWAYS done this if they: knew the state of the world at large, knew what we now accept to be proper care of kids, & knew that it was socially acceptable to not have kids or several. 

We are trying to ""fix"" the birthrate issue as if our old way of doing things was the right way, while many people are coming to understand that humans have always been moving in this direction. People who delve into this and panic want tradition and status quo. Every time I look into someone pushing this into the news, they appear economically, spiritually, or politically motivated. Look into how all the countries that made huge campaigns feel about the rates of foreign adoption and foreign citizenship. Specifically, look at who they are targeting in incentives and promotional material. It isn't encouraging the melting pot of their country to breed. They are encouraging the 'standard'. Look at how much of the studies related to this have ties to Catholicism or religious family studies. And then look at people like Elon Musk who know his whole way of life and dream of colonizing Mars depend on rising birthrates. I am a capitalist American, but we know capitalism is, by definition, predatory in its need for more consumers. 

Also, I don't blame anthropologists for making doomsday theories either way. It is hard to be in an academic profession and not see trends in a vacuum. I think they generally present their arguments very well, and it is the media that makes it look like a horrific dystopian scenario. I just think there is plenty of room for optimism in this, and there needs to be more scrutiny on the bias of many of the people focusing on it as 'dangerous'.",3

In mainstream American discourse, explanations for these trends tend to focus on economic constraints: People are deciding not to have kids because of the high cost of child care, a lack of parental leave, and the wage penalty mothers face. Some policy makers (and concerned citizens) suggest that expensive government interventions could help change people’s minds.

But data from other parts of the world, including countries with generous family policies, suggest otherwise. Today, every OECD country except Israel has a below-replacement fertility rate, and the speed of the decline during the past decade has outpaced demographers’ expectations. In 2022, the average fertility rate of European Union countries was 1.46; in 2023, South Korea’s was 0.72, the lowest in the world.

South Korea has spent more than $200 billion over the past 16 years on policies meant to boost fertility, including monthly stipends for parents, expanded parental leave, and subsidized prenatal care—yet its total fertility rate fell by 25 percent in that time. France spends a higher percentage of its GDP on family than any other OECD member country, but last year saw its lowest number of births since World War II. Even the Nordic countries, with their long-established welfare states, child-care guarantees, and policies of extended parental leave, are experiencing sharp fertility declines.

Policy shifts that make life easier and less expensive for parents are worthwhile in their own right. But so far, such improvements haven’t changed most countries’ low-fertility rates. This suggests the existence of another, under-discussed reason people aren’t having kids—one that, I have come to believe, has little to do with policy and everything to do with a deep but unquantifiable human need.

That need is for meaning. In trying to solve the fertility puzzle, thinkers have cited people’s concerns over finances, climate change, political instability, or even potential war. But in listening closely to people’s stories, I’ve detected a broader thread of uncertainty—about the value of life and a reason for being. Many in the current generation of young adults don’t seem totally convinced of their own purpose or the purpose of humanity at large, let alone that of a child. It may be that for many people, absent a clear sense of meaning, the perceived challenges of having children outweigh any subsidy the government might offer.

In his 1960s work on the economics of the family, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Gary Becker theorized that household decisions, including fertility choices, could be analyzed through an economic lens. More specifically, children could be analogized to goods, like a house or a car; the number that parents had was related to what they could afford in terms of time and money. By this logic, making the goods less expensive—expanding household budgets via subsidies, return-to-career guarantees, and other financial carrots—should be enough to push parents to have more kids.

Governments have generally hewed to this assumption when launching pronatal policies. But two new books exploring why people do or don’t have children—works that take wildly different approaches to the question—suggest that this method is flawed.

In Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth, Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, an economist and a Catholic mother of eight, compiles interviews with 55 women from across the United States who have five or more children—hers is a qualitative study of Americans happily breaking from the low-birth-rate norm. Connecting the author and her unusual subjects (only about 5 percent of U.S. mothers have five or more kids) is a shared certainty that children are an unqualified good, and that raising them is an activity freighted with positive meaning.

Then there are those who are much less sure. In What Are Children For? On Ambivalence and Choice, Anastasia Berg, an academic and editor at The Point, and Rachel Wiseman, an editor at the same magazine, engage literature, philosophy, and anti-natalist texts to wrestle with whether children are worth having at all. The decision is described as “paralyzing” and “anxiety-provoking,” to be approached with trepidation (even though the authors find individual clarity by the end). But their book echoes Pakaluk’s in one striking respect: Both works share the view that current political strategies for encouraging people to have children are lacking a crucial element. “As attractive as economics may be as a solution to the riddle of the growing ambivalence about having children, it is partial at best,” Berg and Wiseman write. Pakaluk observes, “Cash incentives and tax relief won’t persuade people to give up their lives. People will do that for God, for their families, and for their future children.” In other words, no amount of money or social support will inspire people to have children—not unless there is some deeper certainty that doing so makes sense.

In many quarters, that sort of certainty has become elusive. Indeed, Berg and Wiseman dwell on its opposite: anxiety about whether having children is good or whether it’s an imposition, a decision that might deprive a person of individual fulfillment or even make the world worse in the long run—by, for instance, contributing to climate change, overpopulation, or the continuation of regressive gender norms. “Becoming a parent,” they write, “can seem less like a transition and more like throwing yourself off a cliff.”

The authors touch on the standard narratives of why young people are delaying or forgoing children—financial anxiety, difficulty finding a partner, worries that having kids will be incompatible with their career—but these they describe as “externals,” borrowing a term from the family therapist and author Ann Davidman, not the core concern. One of their interviewees notes that if money were no object, she would be “at least neutral” on the subject of having a child, which is still some distance from positive. Instead, more existential worries emerge, pointing to a loss of stabilizing self-confidence among recent generations, or to the lack of an overarching framework (religious or otherwise) that might help guide people toward a “good” life. “The old frameworks, whatever they were, no longer seem to apply,” Berg and Wiseman write. “And the new ones provide us with hardly any answers at all.”

The mothers whom Pakaluk profiles approach childbearing with far less ambiguity. As one told her, “I just have to trust that there’s a purpose to all of it.” Her interviewees’ lives are scaffolded by a sincere belief in providence, in which their religious faith often plays a major role. These mothers have confidence that their children can thrive without the finest things in life, that family members can help sustain one another, and that financial and other strains can be trusted to work themselves out. And although the obvious concerns are present—women describe worries about preserving their physical health, professional standing, and identity—they aren’t determinative. Ann, a mother of six, tells Pakaluk that she doesn’t feel “obliged” to have a large family but that she sees “additional children as a greater blessing than travel, than career … I hope we still get to do some of those things, but I think this is more important. Or a greater good.”

It’s a deceptively simple claim—and reinforces the notion that if people are going to have children, they need more than a hunch that human life is valuable. “It is not just the possibility of goodness but its actuality that fuels our deepest longing to ensure a human future,” Berg and Wiseman propose. And yet, we live in a time when even those who are certain about having kids are sometimes treated with skepticism. To proclaim that parenthood could be a positive experience is, in some circles, slightly gauche. “To assert the goodness of one’s own life,” the authors write, “is to risk coming across as privileged, or just hopelessly naive.”

Contrast that with the attitude of Hannah, a mother of seven who tells Pakaluk that each new child “brings benefit to the family and to the world.” She and the other mothers exemplify what happens when meaning is deeply internalized: Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.",0.005696757230499562,55,"Why would it be a bad thing that we aren’t trying to overpopulate the area in which we live, obliterating resources and creating a potential new COVID situation where the Earth says, “hey….enough!”",2

It’s also true that assholery rolls down hill often, and if someone’s parents made those kinds of thoughts clear they might be likely to do the same if they were not consciously aware of them or the damage they can cause.  But I’ll say that I never got any of that from my parents - even when I lived with my mom after they divorced and she had to work a ton and we never had enough money.  I figured out (using anxious kid negotiating logic) that if my sister and I weren’t around my mom would be having an easier time, and once I said so.  She hugged me and said she never regretted us at all - wished things were easier but nothing changed the fact that she loved to be our mom and we made her life much happier.  My dad loved us too - he was more focused on himself than mom but he did pretty well, especially considering what he’d learned from his parents, because he made a conscious effort not to be them.  I think growing up around that - the knowledge that someone was imperfect but trying to do things right - made it more possible for me to see other people in their struggles and know there would be bad moments but that those weren’t defining.  I’m grateful to and for them. 

And I can also imagine that someone facing a situation that they can’t improve no matter how hard they try might say a lot of things while struggling with that, and a lot of being a parent is trying to stay out in front of despair and feeling like a failure if they can’t provide a solid home situation.  That’s not all parents, and maybe not any parents all the time.  And it’s maybe less common to be clear and apologize to one’s kid for saying something like that, and make sure they understand about people saying things when they are upset that they don’t think when they aren’t.  But it’s better than it was before, seems like.  With any kind of societal correction from something that wasn’t great, there’s a bit of overcorrection too - maybe a tendency of people whose feelings were ignored to prioritize them above all else, which isn’t balanced.  And because feelings get focused on all the time, kids get more anxious and less able to set borders within themselves about what they are going to entertain. 

But it’s reasonable to be at least hesitant about having kids.  It’s a money issue, a social issue, a climate issue, a political one - and speaking to the first one, it’s one thing to be on your own or with a partner and have things be uncertain, and another to have someone who can’t fend for themselves and so you have to take care of them instead of work or work instead of taking care of them.  Critics shouldn’t discount wage stagnancy and the migration of money to the very top; or someone thinking “if I have a daughter and live in Texas or some other deep-red state, they want her to just pump out babies even if she’s a victim of assault”.  But I’m skeptical of hand-wringing articles that underplay the causes of pretty much all of our problems since we began as a country - the powerful doing what they want and misleading the public into being predictable and mostly dumb.  Until that changes the situation will stay the same.  We can make it happen, but we have to show up and vote, and not just once, but every time until we trend to the country we want.",1

People pursued these degrees because we were essentially promised a middle class life.  People would not have gotten the degrees if they would find out the debt burden would just lead to them struggling in the working class while making enough money to ""technically"" make them middle or even upper middle class.

I ask my wife this question all the time, especially after we talk about how lucky we are to even have a 2 bed, 2 bath townhome which is valued WAAYYY more than it needs to be (we bought it at $120K right before the pandemic hit, now valued $250k); who the hell is this society supposed to be for?

Our house is valued highly but all we can do with that value is take out loans against the value that will give us even more debt.  We can't realistically sell our home as all we could do is move into an equally expensive or even MORE expensive home.  We can't pocket the money and go rent because rents are insanely high for no fucking reason.

>Many children tend to result—and, according to these women, bring joy with them.




If a parent's view is inward focused (""what do *I* get out of having children?) as the priority, I think this is immediately a red flag. Children as accessories and pets to pad their parents lives, rather than as measured risks and individuals that *you* forced to drag into existence. These parents typically demand gratitude without providing a reason for it.",0

To say nothing of how stoking anxiety, fear, and capitalizing on human misery has essentially become a business model in places as the world keeps changing at a pace we can barely keep up with and we're constantly beset by yet new uncertainties about what the future holds while the only people who ever seem to tangibly benefit are the rich and powerful who keep growing richer and more powerful while promising it'll all trickle down to the rest of us 'soon (tm).'

People want a sense of meaning - UBI is a policy near entirely aimed at achieving this outcome.

People want a sense of community - the death of third spaces has been talked about endlessly. Government subsidies propping up these spaces, then initiating a massive investment into volunteer-managing staff to run events is a genuine proposal.

The Western move to more individualistic societies came with a new set of crises, but we can solve them. Their novelty shouldn't call for pessimism, but it does because there is no one taking up the banner without an ulterior motive.

How to explain than falling birth rates when societies are getting richer under every aspect. Also non-capitalistic countries are not having better fertility rates. Like what data would convince you that it's not poverty that is pushing fertility rates down? We have all: wealth and fertility change over time, comparison between coutries and economy models etc.

  
And people having different motivations than they believe themselves is not new phenomenon

To me this seems more clear, that the reason women aren't having more kids, is because they're choosing not to. Why is a sensible question: probably because in advanced societies women now can pursue their interests, be this a career, education, travel, or any number of things that isn't being a parent; where before it was socially expected of women to simply get married and start popping them out, now a successful woman CEO, politician, or writer, is a valid life path.",17

I say this as a person who delayed having kids but now have three.  In addition to meeting the right person, it was primarily because of economic security.  

The stuff about the future weighs on my mind at times but I think in a different way than you might expect.  I’m sickened by people like Trump and my main fear is that culture and society will devolve.  I know enough history to realize though that pretty much every age has a mixture of good and bad things.  We should primarily be focused on things like climate, energy, and the environment but instead many people are obsessing over other people’s sex lives.

The people decrying this trend basically don’t want to hear the solutions:
1. Labor needs to be paid more.  If you want more babies there needs to be far more economic security spread much wider.  That means workers make more and capital may make less (initially).  You don’t necessarily need traditional gender roles but you need to be able to support a family with a single income.  That’s very hard to do right now. 
2. The single biggest issue with cost of living in the US is housing.  This can get very controversial but that would need to be addressed.  The solutions are not just “no zoning laws!” or similar free market solutions. It’s likely things like increased investment in infrastructure (public transit), concepts like rent control, increased regulation of the mortgage/finance market (likely including heavy subsidies, e.g. more tax credits etc.)
3. We have major, major issues in the US with work culture as it relates to having children.  Although paid leave for both parents is more common, there is still a lot of stigma around taking it.  Also leaving the workforce for a period of time to care for children is practically career suicide for most people and results in a set back that is often never recovered from- if you’re a successful white collar worker like a doctor or a lawyer, the idea you would take a few years off to raise your kids and then come back and rise/resume a leadership role is basically unheard of.  I’m not sure all of the solutions to that but more employee friendly laws would need to be the start.  Ironically the same people upset about this trend are the same ones that wouldn’t support this.
4.  Subsidizing daycare is often suggested but this is really the tip of a giant iceberg.  The bottom line is that concepts like free school lunch, better schools, extracurricular activities, etc. are all the same issue essentially.  There are many ways this can be solved including increased tax credits for parents sending kids different programs.  The current caps on credits are not proportional to the real costs.
5.  College has gotten absurdly expensive.  The opposition to forgiving student loans is hilarious because that is a small step in avoiding a much bigger issue that will impact the economy more generally (and already has).  This is a complicated topic, but for a lot of families it makes it very challenging to plan for a child’s future.  The solutions are complicated, but personally I think some radical changes are needed- taxing the endowments of elite schools could be a start with an opportunity for them to offset that liability if they provide education to more students.  State schools need to be invested in heavily and expanded aggressively- this includes potentially thinking about how more students could be prepared for trades in a smart way, e.g. a business degree program that also is a plumbing program- why not?
6. Again, work culture in general is bad in the US and you can begin to see how it’s related to the trend when you look at other nations already dealing with this issue, e.g., Korea and Japan.  The solutions are again probably not popular with the same people saying the trend is bad.  The solutions are things like much much more employee friendly laws.  Raising kids basically means you need to be there in the morning and home by dinner time, although remote work for many people has made this easier.  You would likely need things like far more government regulation around things like when overtime must be paid, including to currently “exempt” employees.  This would force employers to either make sure hours are strictly limited to 40 or make it such that it’s very meaningful economically to the employee, who could then afford things like childcare or subsidizing a family member who cares for the kids (could be a spouse but also an older parent/grandparents).  There could also be far more rules in the US around equity in large businesses, e.g., companies pursing stock buybacks could be required by law to sell a proportional amount of shares to employees at a very reduced cost (e.g. one cent per share) to either discourage that behavior or more helpfully ensuring a broader set of workers have economic security if their employer is doing well.
(Edit) 7. Taking better care of the elderly.  Most people I know who have kids are EXTREMELY grateful if they have support from grandparents.  It’s so so hard to overstate how important this is on multiple levels.  Unfortunately, we do not do an incredible job taking care of the elderly in this country and we also tend to think of the family as a nuclear family in the US- fixing that isn’t some Encanto like solution of everyone living in the house necessarily, in fact, I think it’s likely the opposite.  Grandma and grandpa need to be able to have good health so they can be around, they need to be secure in their housing and close by enough that they can see their grandkids, conversely parents need to be able to afford a house near them, and all of them need the time and ability to coordinate this.",2

- Economics - Kids are more expensive than ever due to the quality of life we're expected to give them now, and housing and health care have both scaled well beyond inflation and add extra costs to raising a child

- Isolation - As you point out, people live much more isolated lives. Geographical mobility means its super common to move away from parents and family, losing your social support and not replacing it with anything, family connections are waning and people don't feel like they should have to be burdened by other peoples kids(ever see someone complain about kids crying on a flight? They're so antagonistic to the concept of society they can't even accept that sometimes they'll have to deal with kids crying).

- Entertainment - For multiple generations now home entertainment has gotten easier, cheaper, faster, and better, and more and more we just stay in, and beyond just reducing our social circles and dating opportunities, it also reduces interactions between spouses. Ever had the power go out and realize you banged 5x that day out of boredom?

- Opportunity cost - For women especially, choosing to have kids very frequently puts a significant hurdle into career advancement during the prime advancement portion of careers.

- Reproductive rights - Reproductive freedoms give us all the opportunity to choose when we wouldn't have had that option in years past. 

- Childcare effort - You can't just plop out a kid and do the basics until they're 10 and can help on the farm anymore. You're expected to essentially make being a parent your lifestyle, putting in massive effort into education, extracurriculars, and support up through college. We're K strategists who already had the longest adolescence in the animal kingdom and we keep extending it and demanding more of the parents. 

- Lack of social stigma - My mom said grandma gave her shit for not having kids until 24. There was *intense* social and family pressure on men and women to start a family and start pumping out rugrats. 

- General health - People are significantly overweight, and poor health commonly results in libido issues.",6

That seems like a fine way to get a bunch of screwed-up kids at best, if there's no tax on severe child neglect equivalent to being childless (and tossing people in prison is just less workers to go around, compounding the issue).  People who don't want children will be resentful, and keeping a kid alive is a far cry from turning them into functioning members of society, as victims of our foster care system can attest.

Instead, your life focuses on the child. Like reading? You might have a few hours after the kids go to bed. Like hiking? Good luck, maybe you'll find an inexpensive babysitter for 8-12 hours. 

I like tabletop RPGs. When I inherited my kid (stepchild, technically) it caused a 20 year span where I couldn't do that at all. Similarly, I used to do 3D art. That takes a long time to do, and I lost the time to do that. But, and this is key, I am not resentful (disappointed, yes, but not resentful). My stepchild turned out great, and in no way would they deserve any resentment. I chose to raise them; my lack of time to engage in my hobbies was my choice to make. 

The basic point to this rambling screed is that once you have a child, the great majority of your attention will necessarily focus on your kid. As it should be.",3

Interesting question. I'm late Gen X, raised in a smallish Midwest city in the 1980s. It was definitely more community-like back then. We knew our neighbors and would house-sit when they were on vacation, or just drop by and chat. Kids in the neighborhood would hang out in various groups all the time. We spent a ton of time together and not at home, especially in the summer.

By the time my kids were in the 10-20 age range in the early 2000s nobody did that anymore. Everybody hangs out at home playing video games or doing nothing on the internet.

It feels like the improvements in capability and availability of electronic entertainment devices has a lot to do with the shift. I mean, we had video games, but it was mostly stuff like Atari and original NES. We would hang out together and play for several hours before we got bored late at night and decided to steal the car to go buy beer and roof-surf in the park.

It's still a bit early to tell with my grandkids, but they appear to be somewhat more prone to becoming attached to electronic consumer entertainment than I or their parents were. Unlimited gigabit internet overflowing with non-stop attention-algorithm optimized social media apps mean that they never have an internal reason to stop looking at their devices (just externalities, like mom and dad saying no).

When I was a kid there just wasn't that much interesting stuff to do in front of the screen, plus you generally had to pay for stuff (nothing on the computer or video game console was ad-supported, if you wanted it you either paid for it or found a friend who had), so eventually, even if you were playing with friends, you'd get bored and go get into trouble somewhere else.

Also it feels like stagnant wages and rising entertainment costs push people toward entertainment options that provide a lot of value for the dollar, and video games and social media are undisputed kings there. That means people spend less time doing things together in person, and more of their social time interacting with people who don't live nearby (so they can't hang out in person even if they wanted to).

I'm sure it varies by community, but in my experience, it feels like communities kinda withered away between 1995 and 2005, at the latest.",3

Being a mother defines a woman more than almost anything else in her life. It's going to become the most important thing in your life, before and above everything else. Becoming a mother means putting your physical and mental health, even your *life* on the line during pregnancy and the post-natal period. It means giving up your career goals and personal goals, at least for a few years (and in the case of many careers, that effectively means giving up on it forever). It means always having to put your child before yourself. 

Becoming a mother essentially means a complete surrender of your self, at least while the child is dependent on you, which is usually during the most productive and free years of your life. 

Societally, we just aren't at a place where most men take on equal childrearing duties. Men rarely have to give any of that up when they have children. If things were more equal, having kids might not be as difficult a choice to make for women.",32

I’m pretty firmly in the not having children camp because I’m a lower energy person and I take pride in doing things the right way and well. Having a kid costs energy to do right, and I don’t have enough free energy in my life to meet that need.  So my choice is either to spend all the energy I have and then some burning myself out, or to consciously limit the amount of energy I spend and be a bad father as a result.

Like to a degree I could defray the energy costs with enough money to have a wife that’s a stay at home mom and hiring babysitters and cleaners.

I don’t want to be a distant father figure who might be a provider but isn’t emotionally present in their kids lives.

Now I’ve tried other methods of solving the energy problem, from psychiatric treatment to self medication to trying to find spiritual fulfillment. None of it lasts.

But I guess if children are important the invisible hand of the free market will find a way to adjust that supply and demand curve accordingly.  Everything is magically solved by this one equation. ",5
